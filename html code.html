<h2 style="color:red"><center><b><i>Personal Life</b></i></center></h2>
<p align="justify" display:inline-block "font-size:100px">Styles splits his time between two homes in North London, having previously lived above the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles.[259] He sold his Los Angeles residence, having become disillusioned with the city.[260] He also owns a loft apartment in Manhattan.[261] He lived in the attic of producer Ben Winston's home in Hampstead Heath, London, for 20 months at the beginning of his career while he looked for his own house.[5]

Styles believes in karma, and when Chelsea Handler asked if he believes in God, he stated that he considered himself to be "more spiritual than religious" and that it is "naïve to say nothing exists and there's nothing above us or more powerful than us."[262] In a 2020 interview with Vogue, Styles shared that he practices pilates and meditates daily.[263] He also attends therapy regularly.[42]

He told Vogue in the same interview that he followed a pescatarian diet.[264] In 2022, when fans started throwing chicken nuggets on stage during a concert and chanted that he should eat one, he told them, "I don't eat chicken, sorry. I don't eat meat," earning him PETA's 2022 Best Viral Moment for Animals Award.[265]

Styles confirmed in 2017 that he has polythelia, a condition where a person has more than two nipples.[266]

In May 2019, Styles was named second on the Sunday Times Rich List of musicians in the UK under 30, with an estimated net worth of £58 million, having previously featured third on the previous year's list with an estimated net worth of £50 million.[267][268] He maintained his second-place position on the list in 2020 and 2021, with estimated net worths of £63 million and £75 million, respectively.[269][270] He topped the list in 2022, becoming the richest musician under 30 in the UK, with his net worth being estimated at £100 million.[271]</p>

<h2 style="color:red"><center><b><i>Early Life</b></i></center></h2>
<p align="justify" display:inline-block "font-size:100px"><b style="color:green">Harry Edward Styles </b>(born 1 February 1994) is an English singer, songwriter, and actor. His musical career began in 2010 as part of One Direction, a boy band formed on the British music competition series The X Factor. Each member of the band had been eliminated from the solo contest. They became one of the best-selling boy groups of all time before going on an indefinite hiatus in 2016.

Styles released his self-titled debut solo album through Columbia Records in 2017. It debuted at number one in the UK and the US and was one of the world's top-ten best-selling albums of the year, while its lead single, "Sign of the Times", topped the UK Singles Chart. Styles' second album, Fine Line (2019), debuted atop the US Billboard 200 with the biggest ever first-week sales by an English male artist, and was the most recent album to be included in Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" in 2020. Its fourth single, "Watermelon Sugar", topped the US Billboard Hot 100. Styles' third album, Harry's House (2022), broke several records and was widely acclaimed, receiving the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2023. Its lead single, "As It Was", became the number-one song of the year globally according to Billboard.

Styles has received various accolades, including six Brit Awards, three Grammy Awards, an Ivor Novello Award, and three American Music Awards. His film roles include Dunkirk (2017), Don't Worry Darling, and My Policeman (both 2022). Aside from music and acting, Styles is known for his flamboyant fashion. He is the first man to appear solo on the cover of Vogue.</p><br><br>

<p align="justify" display:inline-block> Following a suggestion from his mother, on 11 April 2010, Styles auditioned as a solo contestant for the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor, singing a rendition of Train's "Hey, Soul Sister". After Simon Cowell suggested that the track was not right for him, he instead sang a rendition of Stevie Wonder's "Isn't She Lovely".[5][12] He advanced to bootcamp but failed to progress further. Four others in his age group who were also eliminated were put together to form a band in July 2010 to compete in the "Groups" category, mentored by Cowell.[13] The group consisting of Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik practised for two weeks;[14][15] Styles suggested the name One Direction to his bandmates, and they agreed to keep it.[16] They began to gain considerable popularity in the UK,[17] and within the first four weeks of the live shows, were Cowell's last act in the competition.[18] The group eventually reached the final of The X Factor and finished in third place.[19]

In January 2011, One Direction signed a recording contract with Cowell's label Syco Records.[20][21] Their UK number one debut single, "What Makes You Beautiful", and their debut studio album, Up All Night, were released later that year.[22][23] The album, which contained three songs co-written by Styles, made One Direction the first British group to have their debut album reach number one in the United States.[24][25] Their four succeeding studio albums—Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013), Four (2014) and Made in the A.M. (2015)—all debuted at number one in the UK.[26] Midnight Memories was the world's best-selling album of 2013,[27] and its accompanying Where We Are Tour was the highest-grossing tour of 2014 and remains the highest-grossing tour of all time by a vocal group.[28] After the release of Four, One Direction became the only group in the 58-year history of the Billboard 200 albums chart to have their first four albums debut at number one.[29] The albums spawned a string of successful singles, including "Live While We're Young", "Little Things", "Best Song Ever", "Story of My Life", "Drag Me Down" and "History".[30][31][32] Styles also co-wrote the song "Just a Little Bit of Your Heart" for Ariana Grande's 2014 album My Everything.[33]

Not wanting to "exhaust" the fan base, upon Styles' suggestion, the band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2016, after completing promotional activities related to Made in the A.M.[5][34][35] Since their debut, One Direction have sold 70 million records worldwide, including 7.6 million albums and 26 million singles in the US, becoming one of the best-selling boy bands of all time.[31][36][37] The group amassed numerous accolades, including seven Brit Awards,[38] seven American Music Awards,[39] six Billboard Music Awards,[40] and four MTV Video Music Awards.[41] While Styles has been generally positive about his time in One Direction, he has revealed that the hyper-visibility he experienced while being in the band was not always easy to deal with.[42] Styles attributed his avoidance of social media to past pressure that he should be constantly accessible online.[42][43] He has spoken about being scared of saying the wrong things in interviews and of fear that not answering questions such as the number of people he slept with would cause journalists to leave the interview annoyed with him.[42] His contracts with One Direction contained "cleanliness clauses" which stated that they would be "null and void" if he did not obey them[...].[42] He expressed that he "burst into tears" when he signed a solo contract without these clauses because he felt "free."[42]</p><br><br>

Styles auditioned for the role of Elvis Presley in Baz Luhrmann's musical biopic Elvis. Luhrmann stated that while "Harry is a really talented actor ... the real issue with Harry is, he's Harry Styles. He's already an icon."[140] Styles starred alongside Florence Pugh in the 2022 psychological thriller film Don't Worry Darling, directed by Olivia Wilde.[141][142] Having premiered at the 79th Venice International Film Festival, the film, as well as his performance, received mixed reviews.[143][144] Steph Green, writing for the BBC, noted that "Harry Styles doesn't feel up to the material here, with leaden line delivery and a lack of light and shade making his scenes opposite Pugh fall flat",[145] but some such as Owen Gleiberman were more positive of his performance, writing that "with his popping eyes, floppy shock of hair, and saturnine suaveness, he recalls the young Frank Sinatra as an actor."[146] Also in 2022, Styles starred alongside Emma Corrin in My Policeman, a film adaptation of the 2012 novel of the same name which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival.[147][148] At the 2022 TIFF Tribute Awards, the main cast of the film were awarded the TIFF Tribute Award for Performance.[149] Despite this, reviews for the film and his performance were less positive, with Robert Daniels of Roger Ebert.com writing, "Here, Styles' inexperience as a leading man in a weepy British queer period piece is glaring".[150]
